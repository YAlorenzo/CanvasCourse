## Description
This project is a compilation of my work based on the [Canvas course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfb6BvBPePaiCNOFpzxeE86R). Each mini-project corresponds to a specific video from the course and showcases various features and techniques of the HTML5 Canvas, such as drawing, animations, music integration, and more.

## Features
- **Drawing on Canvas**: Various techniques for drawing shapes and lines.
- **Canvas Animations**: Implementing movement and animations on the canvas.
- **Music Integration**: Adding music to canvas animations and interactions.
- **Photo and Text on Canvas**: Displaying and manipulating images and text.
- **Creative Illusions**: Visual effects and illusions created with canvas.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Canvas API**: Utilized for rendering and drawing in all projects

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to apply the knowledge gained from the YouTube Canvas course by creating practical, hands-on examples. Each mini-project demonstrates a different aspect of working with the Canvas API, helping to solidify the concepts and techniques covered in the course.
